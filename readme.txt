Yada Wiki is a simple wiki for your WordPress site.

== Description ==
Yada Wiki provides a wiki post type, custom tags and categories, and a table of contents option.  The plugin allows you to link your wiki pages together using the wiki page titles.  

When viewing wiki pages, if the wiki page exists it shows as a link.  If it does not exist, and the user has permissions to edit posts, then the link shows up in red to indicate that the page needs to be created.  You can click on the link to go to the page editor to create the new page.  If the user does not have permissions, then they see the title in red, but no link is available.

There are two easy to use shortcodes, available via buttons on the editor toolbar.  

**Links Shortcode:**
When you click the first button, the wiki link button, a pop-up opens where you enter the two parameters:  

* The "link" parameter takes the title of the wiki page you are linking to.  The "link" parameter is required.
* The "show" parameter takes the link description that you want to show.  The "show" parameter is optional.  If it is blank then the value of the "link" parameter is shown.

For convenience, the pop-up does an AJAX lookup of wiki page titles when you are typing in the "link" field.  

When you click "OK", a shortcode is inserted into your edit window at the cursor location.  

**TOC Shortcode:**
With Yada Wiki, you can create a special wiki post with the title of "TOC", for table of contents, and create a wiki post that will serve as the table of contents for your wiki.  You can use wiki links and style the table of contents as you like in the post editor.  The second button opens a pop-up for the TOC shortcode.  

The TOC shorcode takes two optional parameters:  "Category" and "Order".  If no optional parameter is chosen then the content of the TOC wiki article will show in the shortcode location when the page is viewed.  Note that the TOC only shows if it has been published.  If a "Category" is chosen then that will override the insertion of the TOC content and will instead insert a list of the wiki articles assigned to that category.  The category list can be ordered by article title or by article creation date.  Title is the default.  If no category is chosen the "Order" parameter is ignored.

**Sidebar Widget:**
There is also a widget for showing the TOC article or a category list in the sidebar.  Please see the FAQ section for information about using the sidebar widget.


== Installation ==
You can install the Yada Wiki plugin either via the WordPress.org plugin directory or by uploading the files to your server.  Once the plugin is installed, you can activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
* Can I include external links and links to non-wiki pages in my wiki?

Yes, but the wiki shortcode is only for linking to wiki pages.  If you want to link to external sites or regular posts or pages, then use the usual methods in the post editor to do so, but not the Yada Wiki shortcode.

* How can I add a wiki table of contents menu in the sidebar?

There is now a sidebar widget so that you can include the TOC or a category list of wiki articles. It is a multi-instance widget so you can have more that one version of the widget active at a time.

* Can I use the sidebar widget with Page Builder plugins?

The sidebar widget works well in regular widget areas, but does not work when embedded using Page Builder plugins.  

* Can I nest shortcodes or include multiple TOC Category shortcodes on the same page?

You can include regular wiki link shortcodes in your TOC.  You can also add multiple TOC Category shortcodes to a regular wiki page.  Adding TOC shortcodes to the TOC page, or adding TOC Category shortcodes to the TOC page does not work.

* How can I display the custom tags and categories?  

You can use the tag cloud widget to display the wiki custom tags. There are also plugins in the WordPress repository that will allow you to display custom categories (or taxonomies).  

* After upgrading the plugin the wiki editor buttons are gone. How do I get them back?

The way the buttons are loaded was changed in version 2.  If you do not see the buttons you may need to clear your browser cache.  

* Is the plugin compatible with WordPress multisite?

The plugin is not compatible with multisite.  

* Can I use custom permalinks?

The wiki links are based on links to wiki page titles, so it is expected that you will use the "Post name" type of permalink structure.
