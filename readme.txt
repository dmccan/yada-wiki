Yada Wiki is a simple wiki for your WordPress site.

== Description ==
Yada Wiki provides a wiki post type and an easy to use shortcode, available via a button on the editor toolbar.  When you click the button the shortcode is inserted into your edit window at the cursor location.  The shortcode takes two parameters:  

* The wiki_page parameter takes the title of the page you are linking to.
* The link_text parameter takes the link description that you want to show.

When viewing wiki pages, if the wiki page does not exist, and the user has permissions to create posts and pages, then the link_text shows up in red and can be clicked on to go to the page editor to create the new page.  If the user does not have permissions, then they see the link_text in red, but no link is shown.



== Installation ==
You can install the Yada Wiki plugin either via the WordPress.org plugin directory or by uploading the files to your server.  Once the plugin is installed, you can activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
Q.  Can I include external links and links to non-wiki pages in my wiki?

A.   Yes, but the wiki shortcode is only for linking to wiki pages.  If you want to link to external sites or regular posts or pages, then use the usual methods in the post editor to do so, but not the Yada Wiki shortcode.
